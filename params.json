You will access it through your browser at an address like :\r\n\r\n  >  http://localhost:8080/\r\n\r\nWith this REST Api, you’ll be able to perform the basic CRUD (Create,Read,Update,Delete) operations.\r\n\r\n### Create Route:\r\n > http://localhost:8080/insert/name/shivansh/email/shiv4nsh@gmail.com\r\n\r\n### UpdateViaKeyValuePair Route:\r\n > http://localhost:8080/updateViaKV/name/shivansh/email/shivansh@knoldus.com/id/user::267316c9-75a2-49d2-ae25-791d82b3d5fa\r\n\r\n### Retrieve Via Document id:\r\n > http://localhost:8080/getViaKV/id/user::267316c9-75a2-49d2-ae25-791d82b3d5fa\r\n\r\n### Retrieve via View:\r\n > http://localhost:8080/getViaView/name/shivansh\r\n\r\n### Retrieve via N1QL:\r\n > http://localhost:8080/getViaN1Ql/name/shivansh\r\n\r\n### Delete via Document id:\r\n > http://localhost:8080/delete/id/user::267316c9-75a2-49d2-ae25-791d82b3d5fa\r\n\r\nIn this demonstration, you’ll be interacting with information about people: their name and their email. The Couchbase database will contain one bucket named \"userBucket\" that contains people. Each person document will be represented in JSON: \r\n\r\nYou will be using[Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/) , [Akka-http](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.4.8/scala/http/)and  [Couchbase Spark Connector](http://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/current/connectors/spark-1.0/spark-intro.html)for this project.\r\n\r\n## **What you'll need**\r\n\r\n* 15-30 minutes.\r\n* [A Scala Code editor](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2016.1/creating-and-running-your-scala-application.html)\r\n* [Sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13/docs/Setup.html)\r\n* [Lightbend Activator](https://www.lightbend.com/activator/download)(follow the instructions to install activator and run your first activator application, if you have this activator thtn you do not need the sbt and the scala code editor as it is already provided with it.)\r\n* [Couchbase Server 4.5+] (http://www.couchbase.com/nosql-databases/downloads)(follow the instructions to install Couchbase and create a bucket - this guide assumes you will have it running locally)\r\n\r\n## Setup\r\n\r\n### Install and launch Couchbase\r\nWith your project set up, you can install and launch Couchbase.\r\n    \r\nFor whatever operating system you are using, instructions and downloads can be found at [How to install Couchbase?](http://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/current/install/install-intro.html).\r\n\r\nAfter you install Couchbase, launch it. You should see a webpage opening in your default browser allowing you to setup Couchbase\r\n\r\n## **Running the Application**\r\n\r\nYou can run the application using the following command inside the code directory\r\n\r\n   > sbt run\r\n\r\nand if you are using the activator then use \r\n\r\n  > activator run\r\n\r\n## **Summary**\r\nCongratulations! You set up a Couchbase server and wrote a simple Spark-couchbase-akka-http application that stores a document in Couchbase and provides a basic REST api.\r\n",
